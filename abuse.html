            <h2>Emotional Abuse</h2>
            <p>
                Emotional abuse is a type of abuse that you can experience in an abusive relationship. Although it
                doesn’t leave you with physical scars, it can have a huge impact on your confidence and self-esteem.
                Emotional abuse comes in many forms, which might not
                be obvious at first. If you feel that you may be in an emotionally abusive relationship there are a
                number of things you can do to get support. Many unhealthy relationships involve aspects of emotional
                abuse. The aim of the emotional abuser is to
                chip away at your feelings of self-worth and independence. In an emotionally abusive relationship, you
                may feel that there is no way out or that without your partner you’ll have nothing.

            <h2>Physical Abuse</h2>
            <p>
                Physical abuse often starts gradually, such as with a push or a slap, and then becomes progressively
                worse over time. Physical violence is always illegal. If you have been physically abused, there are
                things you can do to get support. Physical abuse basically
                involves a person using physical force against you, which causes, or could cause, you harm. An abuser
                will often blame someone else, such as the victim, for saying or doing something that ‘caused’ their
                violent behaviour. Or they might say their
                behaviour was a result of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or feeling stressed or
                frustrated.

            <h2>Sexual Abuse</h2>
            <p>
                ‘Sexual assault’ covers a wide range of unwanted sexual behaviours that are often used by offenders as
                a way to assert power and control over their victims. There are many myths around what constitutes
                sexual assault, so find out the facts. If you’ve
                been sexually assaulted, you might experience a range of emotions and it’s important to know there are
                support services that can help you.
